        <h1>Week 1 at BitWise Industries -</h1>
        <p>The idea of coming to Fresno everyday to learn coding at first was a nightmare. My sleeping schedule being out of this world, I have needed to make slight adjustments to it as to not be rude to Matt"Our instructor" given that he is going out of his way to teach us all of this code and I don't want to waste this opportunity. To no surprise everyone at BitWise are friendly and willing to assist me in this learning process. With much to learn I have a heavy work load and have been relieved to see some commands are quite simple. <b>For example how a b tag is similar to a <strong>strong tag</strong>, although it doesn't portray the same message.</b> <I>An I tag is also fairly simple.</I> The last easy tag to remember is <u>underlining my text.</u> Within two days"10 hours" of class I have already learned so much and will make further attempts at retaining this knowledge and improving my skills. Someday I will look back on all of this and laugh at the fact I joined this program with no prior experience and could still keep up! <br> Wish me luck readers!</p>
